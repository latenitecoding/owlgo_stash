Jolie is setting up an art installation for her cat, Millie. The art installation will be made up of multiple LEDs.

Jolie has decided that she needs a specific number of red LEDs, green LEDs, and blue LEDs. After rummaging through her desk, she has found some of each. She can buy two special types of LEDs, one which can be either red or green, and another which can be either green or blue.

How many of the special LEDs will Jolie need to buy to finish her installation?
