## Overview
The code solves an optimization problem where Jolie needs to determine how many special LEDs to buy. The logic appears sound, but there are several areas for improvement.

## Issues and Suggestions

### 1. **Incorrect Logic for Special LED Allocation**

**Critical Issue**: The current logic doesn't correctly handle the allocation of special LEDs.

```rust
// Current (incorrect):
if ghave + (rg - rdef) + (gb - bdef) < gneed {
    println!("-1");
    return;
}
```

**Problem**: You're checking if there are enough green LEDs AFTER allocating to red and blue, but you should be checking if it's *possible* to satisfy all three requirements with optimal allocation.

**Corrected approach**:
```rust
fn solve(rneed: usize, gneed: usize, bneed: usize, 
         rhave: usize, ghave: usize, bhave: usize,
         rg: usize, gb: usize) -> i32 {
    
    // Calculate deficits
    let rdef = rneed.saturating_sub(rhave);
    let bdef = bneed.saturating_sub(bhave);
    let gdef = gneed.saturating_sub(ghave);
    
    // Check if we have enough special LEDs for red and blue
    if rdef > rg || bdef > gb {
        return -1;
    }
    
    // After allocating to red and blue, check remaining for green
    let rg_remaining = rg - rdef;
    let gb_remaining = gb - bdef;
    
    if rg_remaining + gb_remaining < gdef {
        return -1;
    }
    
    (rdef + bdef + gdef) as i32
}
```

### 2. **Error Handling**

**Issue**: `expect()` messages are misleading - they should describe what went wrong, not the expected format.

```rust
// Bad:
io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer).expect("%d %d %d");

// Good:
io::stdin().read_line(&mut buffer).expect("Failed to read input");
```

### 3. **Input Parsing Robustness**

**Issue**: No validation that we received exactly the expected number of values.

```rust
fn parse_three_values(buffer: &str) -> Result<(usize, usize, usize), String> {
    let values: Result<Vec<usize>, _> = buffer
        .trim()
        .split_whitespace()  // Better than split(' ') - handles multiple spaces
        .map(|s| s.parse::<usize>())
        .collect();
    
    match values {
        Ok(v) if v.len() == 3 => Ok((v[0], v[1], v[2])),
        Ok(_) => Err("Expected exactly 3 values".to_string()),
        Err(e) => Err(format!("Parse error: {}", e)),
    }
}
```

### 4. **Code Structure and Separation of Concerns**

**Issue**: Main function does too much. Separate I/O from business logic.

### 5. **Use of `saturating_sub`**

**Issue**: Manual overflow checking with conditionals is verbose.

```rust
// Instead of:
let rdef = if rhave < rneed { rneed - rhave } else { 0 };

// Use:
let rdef = rneed.saturating_sub(rhave);
```

### 6. **Type Choices**

**Issue**: Using `usize` for counts that might need to represent -1 is awkward.

**Better**: Use `i32` or `i64` for the calculation, or use `Option<usize>`.

## Complete Refactored Solution

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut lines = stdin.lock().lines();
    
    let (rneed, gneed, bneed) = parse_line(&mut lines, "needed LEDs")
        .expect("Failed to parse needed LEDs");
    
    let (rhave, ghave, bhave) = parse
