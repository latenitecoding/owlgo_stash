## Problem Overview

Jolie needs a specific number of each LED color for her art installation, but she only has some of them. She needs to determine how many special LEDs to buy to complete the installation.

## Important Concepts and Constraints

1. **Three types of needs**: Jolie needs specific amounts of red, green, and blue LEDs
2. **What she already has**: She found some red, green, and blue LEDs in her desk
3. **Special LEDs available for purchase**:
   - Red/Green (RG) LEDs: Can be configured as EITHER red OR green (not both)
   - Green/Blue (GB) LEDs: Can be configured as EITHER green OR blue (not both)
4. **The goal**: Find the minimum number of special LEDs needed to meet her requirements

## Key Insight

The tricky part is that **green can be satisfied by either RG or GB LEDs**, while:
- Red can only be satisfied by RG LEDs
- Blue can only be satisfied by GB LEDs

This creates an optimization problem: how should you allocate the special LEDs to minimize the total purchase?

## Potential Edge Cases

1. **Impossible scenarios**: What if she needs more red LEDs than RG LEDs available? Or more blue than GB available?
2. **Insufficient green coverage**: What if after satisfying red and blue needs, there aren't enough special LEDs left to cover the green requirement?
3. **Already have enough**: What if she already has all the LEDs she needs?
4. **Excess special LEDs**: What if there are leftover RG or GB LEDs after covering red/blue - can they help with green?

## Algorithm Considerations

Looking at your code, I notice you're using a greedy approach:
- First satisfy red needs with RG LEDs
- Then satisfy blue needs with GB LEDs
- Then check if remaining special LEDs can cover green

**Question to consider**: Is this always optimal? Think about this scenario:
- Need: 5 red, 10 green, 5 blue
- Have: 0 of each
- Available: 7 RG, 7 GB

Your current approach would use 5 RG for red and 5 GB for blue, leaving 2 RG + 2 GB = 4 special LEDs for 10 green needs. That's insufficient!

But what if you could use different amounts for red and blue to maximize what's left for green?

## Things to Think About

1. Is there a better allocation strategy than the greedy approach?
2. How do you balance the competing demands for the special LEDs?
3. When exactly is it impossible to meet the requirements?
4. What's the actual value you're trying to minimize - total LEDs bought or something else?

The problem is essentially about optimally allocating limited flexible resources (the special LEDs) to meet specific demands where some demands have multiple supply options (green) while others don't (red and blue).
